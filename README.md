npm install express knex pg dotenv
npm install --save-dev jest supertest nodemon
npm install express-validator

Great to hear it's all working! Now you have a complete event booking system with:

Ticket management
Concurrent booking support
Waiting list functionality
Detailed endpoints for viewing tickets and waiting lists
Cancellation handling with automatic waiting list processing

All of these features are working together seamlessly. The waiting list position is being handled correctly, and users can view both available tickets and the waiting list through the new endpoints.
Would you like to add any other features or shall we consider this implementation complete?
